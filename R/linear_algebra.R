# Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
# An eigenvalue is a scalar that represents how much a given matrix stretches 
# or shrinks a particular vector when multiplied by it.
# An eigenvector is a non-zero vector that is only scaled by a scalar factor
# when multiplied by the matrix.


# Singular Value Decomposition and Determinants
# The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a matrix into three matrices.
# The left and right matrices represent the rotation of the input data
# into a new coordinate system, and the middle matrix represents the scaling
# of the data along each axis.

# Determinants:
# The determinant of a matrix is a scalar that represents how much the matrix scales 
# the area or volume of a given region in space.


# LU and QR Decomposition:
# The LU and QR decompositions are methods for factoring a matrix into 
# a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix or
# an orthogonal matrix and a triangular matrix, respectively.


# Least Squares Fitting:
# Least squares fitting is a method for finding the best-fit line or
# curve that passes through a set of points by minimizing the 
# sum of the squared errors between the predicted and observed values.


# Forming Partitioned Matrices: 
# Partitioned matrices are matrices that are split into smaller submatrices.
# They are used to simplify calculations or to represent systems of equations.


# Solving linear systems:
# Solving linear systems involves finding the solution of a set of linear equations.
# There are various methods for solving linear systems,
# including Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, and QR decomposition.
